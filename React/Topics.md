# Frontend Developer Interview Preparation Roadmap (React Focus)

## 1. React Basics

- **JSX Syntax**: A syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. **`Done`**
- **React Components**: Reusable building blocks of a React application. Can be functional or class-based.
- **Props & State**: Props are used to pass data to components, while state allows components to manage their own data.
- **Component Lifecycle**: The stages a component goes through, including mounting, updating, and unmounting (mainly for class components).
- **Handling Events in React**: Using event handlers to respond to user actions like clicks or form submissions.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Rendering components or elements based on conditions.
- **Lists & Keys**: Rendering lists of items using `.map()` and uniquely identifying elements with keys.
- **Forms in React**: Managing form elements using controlled or uncontrolled components.

## 2. React Advanced Concepts

- **Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)**: Functions that allow you to manage state and side effects in functional components.
- **Custom Hooks**: User-defined functions that can extract component logic into reusable functions.
- **Context API**: A way to share data globally across the component tree without passing props manually at each level.
- **Error Boundaries**: React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child components and display a fallback UI.
- **React Router**: A library for handling navigation and routing in a React application.
- **Portals**: A way to render children into a different part of the DOM tree, outside of their parent component.
- **Refs (useRef, forwardRef)**: A way to access and interact with DOM elements directly.

## 3. State Management

- **State in React (useState)**: A hook to manage local component state.
- **useReducer vs useState**: `useReducer` is an alternative to `useState` for managing more complex state logic.
- **Context API**: Used for simple state management across components without needing external libraries.
- **Redux**: A state management library for managing global state with actions, reducers, and a store.
- **Redux Thunk or Redux Saga**: Middleware libraries to handle side effects like API calls in Redux.
- **Recoil or Zustand**: Modern alternatives to Redux for more flexible state management in React.

## 4. Performance Optimization

- **React.memo**: A higher-order component that memoizes a component to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **useMemo and useCallback**: Hooks to memoize values or functions to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary recalculations.
- **Lazy Loading Components**: Dynamically importing components only when they are needed.
- **Code Splitting**: Splitting the application code into smaller chunks to load only the required code.
- **React Profiler**: A tool for measuring the performance of your components and identifying slow renders.
- **Avoiding Unnecessary Re-renders**: Best practices to prevent components from re-rendering unnecessarily.
- **Virtualization (react-window, react-virtualized)**: Techniques for rendering large lists efficiently by only rendering visible items.

## 5. Testing in React

- **Unit Testing with Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework for testing individual functions or components.
- **React Testing Library**: A library for testing React components by simulating user interactions and asserting on rendered output.
- **Mocking API Calls**: Using Jest to mock external API calls to test components without actual network requests.
- **Test Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before the actual implementation to ensure code quality and reliability.

## 6. Styling in React

- **CSS-in-JS (styled-components, Emotion)**: Writing CSS styles directly inside JavaScript using libraries like `styled-components` or `Emotion`.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped CSS for components to avoid global styles leakage.
- **Sass or LESS**: Preprocessor languages that enhance CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.
- **TailwindCSS Basics**: Utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without writing custom CSS.
- **Responsive Design**: Designing your app to be mobile-friendly and adapt to different screen sizes.
- **CSS Flexbox and Grid**: Layout systems for building complex and responsive grid structures.

## 7. Build Tools & Optimization

- **Webpack**: A module bundler used to bundle JavaScript files and assets for deployment.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler that converts modern JavaScript (ES6+) into backward-compatible code.
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code quality and formatting tools to enforce style and consistency across the project.
- **Create React App**: A tool to create React apps with a predefined project structure and development tools.
- **Vite or Next.js**: Modern build tools and frameworks for fast development (Vite) and server-side rendering (Next.js).
- **Code Splitting and Tree Shaking**: Techniques to reduce the size of your JavaScript bundles by splitting code and removing unused code.

## 8. Version Control & Deployment

- **Git Fundamentals**: Version control for tracking changes in your codebase. Learn branching, merging, and pull requests.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Jenkins**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Deployment to Vercel, Netlify, or AWS**: Hosting platforms for deploying React apps with minimal configuration.

## 9. API Integration

- **REST APIs**: A set of conventions for creating web services using HTTP methods and status codes.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs, allowing clients to request only the data they need.
- **Apollo Client**: A library to interact with GraphQL APIs, managing data fetching, caching, and state.

## 10. Soft Skills & Problem Solving

- **Behavioral Questions**: Prepare for common interview questions using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
- **System Design Basics**: Understand how to structure an app, split responsibilities, and design scalable systems.
- **Code Challenges & Algorithm Practice**: Practice solving algorithmic problems on platforms like LeetCode, Codewars, or HackerRank.

## 11. Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

- **Arrow Functions, Destructuring, Template Literals**: Modern syntax that improves readability and conciseness.
- **Spread Operator, Rest Parameters**: Allows for easier manipulation of objects and arrays.
- **Promises, async/await**: Handling asynchronous code in a cleaner, more manageable way.
- **Modules (import/export)**: Organizing JavaScript code into separate files for better maintainability.
- **Closures, this Keyword**: Understanding how JavaScript handles scope and function context.
- **Event Loop & Asynchronous Behavior**: Understanding how JavaScript manages asynchronous code execution.

## 12. Progressive Web Apps (PWA) Basics

- **Service Workers**: Scripts that run in the background, allowing features like caching and offline support.
- **App Manifests**: A configuration file that describes how the app should appear when installed on a user's device.
- **Offline-first Design**: Designing apps that prioritize working offline by caching data and assets.

## 13. Additional Topics

- **TypeScript Basics with React**: Adding static typing to React projects with TypeScript.
- **Next.js / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Framework for building React apps with server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Mobile-first Design & React Native**: Designing for mobile devices first and understanding how React Native enables mobile app development.
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Making your React apps accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- **SEO Fundamentals (for SPAs)**: Implementing SEO best practices to make single-page applications (SPAs) discoverable by search engines.
